# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboard allows users to visualize and analyze the microbial species present in the dataset using a horizontal bar chart and a dropdown menu.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is called "Belly Button Biodiversity" and can be accessed from the following URL: Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset.

The dataset provides information about operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represent the microbial species found in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of OTUs are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

# Features

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard offers the following features:

Horizontal Bar Chart: The dashboard displays a horizontal bar chart representing the top 10 OTUs found in an individual's navel. The length of each bar corresponds to the frequency of the OTU in the individual's sample.

Dropdown Menu: A dropdown menu allows users to select an individual by ID. Upon selecting an ID, the dashboard updates the bar chart to show the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
